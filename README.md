### Ideas
- N tweets per day of the week, time of day, date 
- N tweets per person -> trended (need to do "Tom" and "Tommy" differently)
- Bigram and trigram analysis (can we pull out couples??)
- Topic models per day, week, all time 
- Most "influential people" (by likes / retweets)
- Sentiment per person 
- "Weighted" sentiment (n likes/retweets)
